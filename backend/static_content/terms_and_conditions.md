Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms") carefully before using the Subsynapse service (the "Service") operated by `[Your Name / Team Name]` ("us", "we", or "our").

By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms.

## 1. The Service

* A **"Group Member"** is a user who joins a group to share the cost.

## 5. Critical: Third-Party Terms & Limitation of Liability

* **You are solely responsible** for reviewing and complying with the Terms and Conditions of any third-party subscription service you share (e.g., Netflix, Spotify, etc.).

* Subsynapse is **NOT LIABLE** for any action taken by a third-party subscription service, including but not limited to account suspension, termination, penalties, or legal action.
* **We are not responsible** for any user misconduct, including a Group Owner deleting a group, a member failing to pay, or any violation of third-party terms.
* THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS." WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE.

## 6. Fees and Payments

* We charge a **platform fee** and a **processing fee** for facilitating the service. These fees will be clearly disclosed to you before any transaction.
* Payments are processed by our third-party partner, Razorpay.
* You may choose between a "Temporary" (upfront) or "Monthly" (recurring autopay) payment plan.

## 7. Termination

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account without notice if you:

* Breach these Terms.
* Fail to make payments on time.
* Use the platform for any illegal, fraudulent, or unfair purpose.
* Share a subscription with more people than you have paid for.

## 8. Changes to These Terms

We may modify these Terms at any time. We will provide notice of significant changes. Continued use of the Service after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.
